# Chicago Bulls Dynasty Roster

This react app showcases the 12 members of the 1991-92 Bulls. Each player has their player's card on the front and when the mouse hovers over it spins over and shows a breakdown of their stats. There is also a search bar that lets you filter the players by either their first or last name.
