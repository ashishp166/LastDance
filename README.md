## Description

Due to the current state of the Chicago Bulls franchise, I decided to show off the roster that started the dynasty which eventually won 6 rings. This react app showcases the 12 members of the 1991-92 Bulls. Each player has their player's card on the front and when the mouse hovers over it spins over and shows a breakdown of their stats. There is also a search bar that lets you filter the players by either their first or last name.
